SOFTWARE REQUIRED:- GITHUB AND EDAPLAYGROUNDS.
PROCESS & PROCEDURE:- 1)OPEN THE “GITHUB.COM/VISION-VLSI” IN GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE 
FIG1 SHOWS THE HOME PAGE OF THE GITHUB.
2)ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OVERVIEW WE SEE “REPOSITORIES”.
 
FIG2 SHOWS THE REPOSITORIES OPTION
3)AS WEE CLICK ON REPOSITORIES WE SEE “VERILOG” TERM.
 
FIG3 SHOWS THE VERILOG TERM
4) NOW CLICK ON VERILOG AND WE SEE THE LIST OF CONTENT AS BELOW
 
FIG4 SHOWS THE LIST OF CONTENT
5)NOW CLICK ON “COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS” FROM THE CONTENT LIST 
FIG5 SHOWS THE COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT OPTION
6)AS WE CLICK ON COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT WE GET THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GATE MODELLING 
FIG7 SHOWS THE LEVEL MODELING
7)NOW CLICK ON 2 GATE LEVEL MODELLING AND WE GET THE LIST OF GATES WHICH WE WANT TO DO SIMULATION 
FIG8 SHOWS THE LIST OF GATES FOR SIMULATION
9)NOW CLICK ON FULLADDER AS WE CLICK ON ENCODER4TO2 WE GET THE DESIGN CODE AND TESTBENCH CODE FOR ENCODER4TO2  SIMULATION.
 FIG9 SHOWS THE DESIGN.SV CODE FOR ENCODER4X2.
 
FIG9 SHOWS THE TESTBENCH.SV CODE FOR ENCODER4X2.
10)NOW COPPY THE TESTBENCH.SV & DESIGN.SV CODES TO EDAPLAYGROUNDS IN THERE SPECIFIC AREAS.
 
FIG10 SHOWS THE TESTBENCH.SV & DESIGN.SV CODES IN THERE RESPECTIVE AREAS.
